# Copilot Instructions for GDScript

## Code Style

### Indentation
- Use tabs for indentation, not spaces.

### Type System
- Always use explicit static types. Never rely on type inference.
- Variables: `var player_id: int = 0`
- Function returns: `func get_player_id() -> int:`
- Constants: `const MOVE_SPEED: float = 5.0`
- Replace all magic numbers and strings with named constants.

### Node References
- Use `@onready` with explicit type annotations and node path syntax.
- Example: `@onready var collision_shape: CollisionShape3D = $CollisionShape3D`
- Always specify the full type name (e.g., `CollisionShape3D`, never inferred types).
- This ensures type safety, performance (nodes are cached), and self-documenting code.

### Naming Conventions
- `snake_case` for functions and variables: `var player_position`, `func calculate_damage()`
- `PascalCase` for classes and types: `class PlayerController`, `enum GameState`
- Prefix private functions with underscore: `func _process_input() -> void:`

## Code Organization

### Variable Declaration Order
1. Signals
2. Const declarations
3. @export variables
4. @onready variables
5. Regular var declarations

### Function Declaration Order
1. Built-in lifecycle functions (_ready, _process, _physics_process, etc.)
2. Private functions (prefixed with underscore)
3. Public functions

## Control Flow

- Use null checks and early returns instead of nested conditionals.
- Use guard clauses to exit early.
- Example:
  ```gdscript
  # Bad: Nested conditionals
  func process_player(player: Node) -> void:
      if player != null:
          if player.is_alive():
              if player.has_weapon():
                  player.attack()
  
  # Good: Early returns
  func process_player(player: Node) -> void:
      if player == null:
          return
      if not player.is_alive():
          return
      if not player.has_weapon():
          return
      player.attack()
  ```

## Error Handling

- Use explicit error handling. Never fail silently.
- Print errors or emit signals when issues occur.
- Example:
  ```gdscript
  func load_config(path: String) -> bool:
      if not FileAccess.file_exists(path):
          push_error("Config file not found: " + path)
          return false
      # Load config...
      return true
  ```

## Data Structures

### Typed Classes vs Dictionaries
- Always use typed classes (`Resource` or `RefCounted`) instead of untyped dictionaries for data structures.
- Provides type safety, IDE autocomplete, and proper type inference.
- Use for: data transfer objects, configuration objects, state containers.

#### Data Transfer Objects
- Use `Resource` or `RefCounted` classes instead of dictionaries to pass data between nodes.
- Extend `Resource` for serialization/saving, or `RefCounted` for lightweight data objects.
- Example:
  ```gdscript
  class_name PlayerData
  extends Resource
  
  var player_name: String = ""
  var health: int = 100
  var position: Vector3 = Vector3.ZERO
  
  func _init(name: String = "", hp: int = 100, pos: Vector3 = Vector3.ZERO) -> void:
      player_name = name
      health = hp
      position = pos
  ```
- Usage:
  ```gdscript
  # Bad: Untyped dictionary
  func get_player_info() -> Dictionary:
      return {"name": "Player", "health": 100, "position": Vector3.ZERO}
  
  # Good: Typed class
  func get_player_info() -> PlayerData:
      return PlayerData.new("Player", 100, Vector3.ZERO)
  ```

### Abstract Base Classes
- Use `@abstract` for base classes that define shared behavior but cannot be directly instantiated.
- Abstract classes must extend a Godot type (Node, CharacterBody3D, etc.) and are for inheritance only.
- Example:
  ```gdscript
  @abstract
  class_name Character
  extends CharacterBody3D
  
  @export var health: int = 100
  @export var speed: float = 5.0
  @export var acc: float = 2.5  ## acceleration
  @export var dec: float = 5.0  ## deceleration
  ```
- Extend in child classes:
  ```gdscript
  class_name Player
  extends Character
  
  @export var stamina: float = 100.0
  ```

## Code Architecture

### Composition Over Inheritance
- Use composition and component-based architecture instead of deep inheritance hierarchies.
- Attach scripts as components to nodes rather than creating complex base classes.
- Keep inheritance chains shallow (1-2 levels maximum).

### Loose Coupling
- Avoid tight coupling between systems and scripts.
- Use signals and event buses for communication between unrelated systems.
- Pass dependencies explicitly through function parameters or autoloads.
- Minimize direct node references. Use node paths or signals instead.

### Modularity
- Keep scripts focused on a single responsibility.
- Split large functionality into separate scripts/components.
- Organize code:
  - `systems/` - Cross-cutting concerns and managers
  - `autoloads/` - Global services used by multiple systems

## Code Patterns

### Event Bus Signals
- Use public signals (no underscore prefix) in event bus systems.
- Provide wrapper functions to emit signals. Never emit signals directly from external code.
- Cache values as private variables with getter functions when needed.
- Example:
  ```gdscript
  signal player_moved(position: Vector3)
  var _current_player_position: Vector3 = Vector3.ZERO
  
  func emit_player_moved(position: Vector3) -> void:
      _current_player_position = position
      player_moved.emit(position)
  
  func get_player_position() -> Vector3:
      return _current_player_position
  ```
- This provides encapsulation, validation hooks, and a clear API surface.

## Documentation

### Code Comments
- Avoid excessive documentation.
- Use self-documenting variable and function names.
- Only comment non-obvious logic or complex algorithms.

### Markdown Files
- Do not generate documentation (.md) files unless explicitly requested.

### UID Files
- Never manually create or edit Godot .uid files (`*.tscn.uid`, `*.gd.uid`, etc.).
- The Godot editor automatically manages these files.
- Manual editing causes conflicts and inconsistent asset metadata.
